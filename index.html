				<h1>About Me!</h1>
				<p>In high school, I embarked on my programming journey using BlueJ as my starting point. 
					Soon after, I delved into the world of HTML, utilizing it to craft and personalize my Tumblr page. 
					My penchant for hands-on activities led me to engaging in physics laboratories, 
					where I tackled projects like constructing miniature bridges, rollercoasters, and even designing a hamster maze within a themed park.
					These experiences solidified my passion for Computer Engineering, motivating me to pursue it as my major.
				</p>
			 	<p>During my college journey, I expanded my knowledge and skills. 
					I delved into x86 Assembly, Java, and C programming. 
					Additionally, I honed my circuit design expertise with a focus on VHDL, Verilog, and other logical designs. 
					I explored a variety of microcontrollers, including the STM32 board, Texas Instrument board, and Arduino.
					In this current spring semester, I am studying Database Management Systems and Software Engineer concept.
			 	</p>
			 	<p>When I step away from my academic pursuits, you'll often find me engaged in workouts or enjoying spirited volleyball matches with my friends. 
					During breaks, I immerse myself in the world of Asian dramas, particularly Korean and Japanese productions, indulge in Anime, or groove to K-pop tunes.
